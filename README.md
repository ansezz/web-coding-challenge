    mongorestore --db shops shops/

‚Üí‚Üí A shop database will be created with a shops collection.

## How we'll evaluate üö®
- Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices, legibility.
- The git commit history will be also evaluated.
- Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines?
- Put more focus on code quality and less on speed. Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean.


## Once you're done with the app

Put the code of your project on Github and send the URL to us.
